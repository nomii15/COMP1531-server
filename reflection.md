As a team we are really happy with how iteration 1 of the project has panned out, in terms of the completion of the functions outlined by Bob and Sally as well as our success in completing the assigned tasks in the specified time. The team's initial plan consisted of three main goals:
    
    1. Fair, even workload split
    2. Frequent meetings
    3. Code examination
    
From the initial assignment of the task, as a team we split the 32 functions into groups of 4, where each member would be responsible for 8 functions. This split was done in a logical way where each function group would relate to a certain functionality such as message functions, authorisation functions etc. as this meant a team member had a more specific and deeper outlook on the work they were doing. After this split, each memeber went away and starting their implementations. 

As a team, we decided to use Facebook Messenger as a medium of communication. This was mainly used for minor isses and clarifications when implementing the functions as well as aspects of the functions we felt that Sally and Bob were quite vague about. Additionally, we also had frequent in person meetings. This was crucial to the success of our first iteration as, in some cases, would notice a misunderstanding of the requirements of a function and were able to reclarify. We also used these meetings as an opportunity to examine the code of one another and make any suggestions or recomendations on any improvements. Although this did not occur, another purpose of these meetings was to be able to see the progress of each team members work as we were wary that some members could be shy and/or slow in their work in which we could then push them in the right direction.

Overall, as a team we are really happy with how this iteration as worked out, and are looking forward to hearing the clarfications regarding some of the ambiguity surrounding some of the functions as well as getting a start on iteration 2 of the project.
