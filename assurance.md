From the backend developed over iteation two, the way in which our group attemped
to validate and verify the functions that make up the backend were through 
acceptance criteria and testing of indivdual function with different inputs.

Acceptance criteria was used to better help our group in determining whether a 
particular function had meet its intended functionality specified by Sally and Bob.
For the funtions that make up the backend, the ways in which acceptance criteria was 
generated was through a series of questions, which were

    1. What is the overall success case of ths funtion
    2. Edge cases, where could this function run into any problems
    3. Other interesting cases, the outcome of this functions impact on other functons
    
All of the acceptance criteria generated for the functions are kept within the 
user stories in the taskboard. This allows our group to keep the focus on the 
requirements which Sally and Bob want and not get off track. It also allow the 
group to effectively plan out what needs to be done and how the functions are going to be
implemented with resect to the acceptance criteria.

Another way in which the backend developed in iteration 2 was verified and validated was through
several test cases. These test cases allow for verifying that the backend developed
is pratical for what Sally and Bob wanted. Testing for this iteation was done by manual and 
automated testing methods; which included running postman with different inputs and seeing the output, and 
automating it by mimicking the server through classes which comprised of the functions and variables used
in the individual functions. Due to some of the functions not being fully implemented and others which contain 
bugs and cannot be properly tested. When performing the testing, cases that were considered were

    1. Correct input with resulted in correct output
    2. Invalid input which raises exceptions
    3. Cases which could impact other functons
    
It is using the strategies above that allowed our group to attempt to validate
the behaviour of the fuctions are verify that the functions say what they are going
to do.

During this iteration, not all functions could be tested due to the complications 
in which our group ran into; like taking more time to write some of the functions
which we planned to take less time. As a result of this, some of the testing was done 
manually and some of the automated testing also assumed that some of the other 
functions it needed were fully working when they wern't. The stand up functions 
were also not imlemented due to the complications which occured throughout iteration.
For the next iteration, more testing would have to be done on the functions which our group
couldn't finalise in the backend before the connecton with the frontend. This would 
give more verification and validation that the system works as a whole and not 
in individual components only.
