From the backend developed over iteation two, the way in which our group attemped
to validate and verify the functions that make by the backend are through 
acceptance criteria and through testing of indivdual function with different inputs.

Acceptance criteria was used to better help our goup in determining whether a 
particular function had meet it intended functionality specified by sally and bob.
For the funtions comprising the backend, the ways in which acceptance criteria were 
generated was through a series of questions, which were

    1. what is the overall success case of ths funtion
    2. edge cases, where could this function run into any problems
    3. other interesting cases, the outcome of this functions impact on other functons
    
All of the acceptance criteria generated for the functions are kept within the 
user stories in the taskboard. this allows our group to keep the focus on the 
requirements which sally and bob want and not get off track. It also allow the 
group to effectively plan out what needs to be done and how they are going to be
done with resect to the acceptance criteria.

Another way in which the backend developed in iteration 2 was validated was through
several test cases. These test cases allow for verifying that the backend developed
is pratical for what sally and bob wanted. Testing for this iteation was done manually,
this was due to the difficulties of setting up an automated tests with our groups
test files. When performing the testing, cases that were considered were

    1. correct input with resulted in correct output
    2. invalid input which raises exceptions
    3. cases which could impact other functons
    
It is using the strategies above that allowed our group to attempt to validate
the behaviour of the fuctions are verify that the functions say what they are going
to do.

During this iteration, not all functions could be tested due to the complications 
in which our group ran into; like taking more time to write some of the functions
which we planned to take less time.For the next iteration, more testing would have to 
be done on the functions which our group couldn't finalise in the backend before
the connecton with the frontend.
