Assumptions

1)  The variables first_name and last_name cannot be empty (i.e. “”). This is to assure that u_id is not blank.

2)  When testing individual functions, if that function being tested depends on another; it is assumed that function is working correctly.

3)  When creating test scenarios of functions for iteration 1, the exact data structure which the information is stored is assumed and could change when implementing the actual function.

4)  When using the search function, an error is thrown when the user is looking for a message which is greater than 1000 characters.

5)  The search function also looks for the prefix of a query string.
